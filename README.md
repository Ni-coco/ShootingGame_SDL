ShootingGame with SDL library.
The controls are :
- 'Arrows' for moving
- 'SPACE' to shoot
- 'R' to reload
- 'ESC' to pause & quit

(Note to myself) -> To compile this, run "gcc .\src\main.c -o bin/prog -I include -L lib -lmingw32 -lsdl2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image".
Don't forget to have all the .h in the include folder and also don't forget the .dll in the same folder as the .exe or .out.
